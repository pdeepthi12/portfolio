## Setting Up the Repository

If you want to rename the default branch from `master` to `portfolio_feature` and configure your local and remote branches accordingly, follow these steps:

### 1. Rename the Default Branch:

Run the following command to rename the local `master` branch to `portfolio_feature`:

```bash
git branch -m master portfolio_feature
```

### 2. Fetch the latest changes from the remote repository:
```bash
git fetch origin
```

### 3. Set the upstream branch for the `portfolio_feature` branch:
```bash
git branch -u origin/portfolio_feature portfolio_feature
```
### 4. Update the HEAD to point to all branches on the remote repository:
```bash
git remote set-head origin -a
```
## Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pdeepthi12/portfolio.git
```
- cd portfolio
